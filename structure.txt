Reproducible research

Lorena Manifesto 

I will teach my graduate students about reproducibility.
All our research code (and writing) is under version control.
We will always carry out verification and validation (V&V reports are posted to figshare)
For main results in a paper, we will share data, plotting script & figure under CC-BY
We will upload the preprint to arXiv at the time of submission of a paper.
We will release code at the time of submission of a paper.
We will add a "Reproducibility" declaration at the end of each paper.
I will keep an up-to-date web presence.
