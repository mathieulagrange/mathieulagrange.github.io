  A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, <br>
  called 
  <span ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][1]}"> 
    an elephant, <br>
  </span>
  <span ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][2]}">
    had been brought to the town, <br>
  </span>
  <span ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][3]}">
    but none of them were aware of its shape and form. 
  </span>
  <br>
</p>
<p ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][4]}"> 
  Out of curiosity, they said: <br>
  "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". <br>
  <span ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][5]}"> 
    So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. 
  </span>
</p>
<p ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][6]}"> 
  In the case of the first person, <br>
  whose hand landed on the trunk, <br>
  said  
  <span ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][7]}"> 
    "This being is like a drain pipe". 
  </span>
</p>
<p ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][8]}"> 
  For another one whose hand reached its ear, <br>
  it seemed like 
  <span ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][9]}"> 
    "A kind of fan". 
  </span>
</p>
<p ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][10]}"> 
  As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, <br>
  said, <span ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][11]}"> 
    "I perceive the shape of the elephant to be like a pillar"
  </span>.
</p>
<p ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][12]}"> 
  And in the case of the one who placed <br> his hand upon its back said, 
  <span ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][13]}"> 
    "Indeed, this elephant is like a throne" 
  </span>.
</p>
<p ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][14]}"> 
  Now, each of these presented a true aspect <br>
  when he related what he had gained from experiencing the elephant. <br>
  <span ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][15]}"> 
    None of them had strayed from the true description of the elephant.
  </span>
</p>
<p ng-style="{opacity:opacity[6][16]}"> 
  Yet they fell short of fathoming the true appearance of the elephant.<br>
